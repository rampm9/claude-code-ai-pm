# Claude Code for AI Product Managers

My 8-week structured learning journey to master AI product management through hands-on practice with Claude Code.

## 👋 About This Journey

I'm Ram, a Product Manager with 13+ years of experience across media, fintech, and telecom. I've shipped products with $80M+ revenue impact and 3M+ downloads across BBC, Etisalat, and Asharq News.

Despite these achievements, I've hit a career ceiling. Zero promotions. Zero awards.

The solution? Master AI product management from first principles.

This repository is my laboratory. Everything I learn, build, and discover about AI products gets documented here.

## 🎯 Goals

**Skills I'll Master:**
- Design and prototype AI features independently
- Write AI product requirements that engineers can execute
- Analyze product data using AI-powered workflows
- Understand AI product trade-offs (accuracy vs. latency vs. cost)
- Evaluate AI product feasibility and impact

**What I'll Build:**
- 8 comprehensive learning modules with guides
- 8 video tutorials (2-5 min each)
- 8 detailed blog posts (800-1200 words)
- 3 working AI prototypes (portfolio-ready)
- 1 complete AI product case study

**Career Outcome:**
- Position myself as AI PM expert in MENA
- Build interview-ready portfolio
- Land Senior PM or AI PM role at 45k AED monthly

## 💡 Why This Journey Matters

**The Honest Truth:**

13 years as a Product Manager. Multiple successful products. Significant business impact.

Zero promotions. Zero recognition.

I could be bitter. Or I could evolve.

**The AI Product Manager gap is real:**
- Companies need PMs who understand AI deeply
- Most PMs talk about AI, few can build with it
- MENA market has massive AI opportunity
- Experience + AI skills = career breakthrough

**This repository is my proof of work.**

Not just talking about AI. Building with it. Documenting everything. Sharing publicly.

By Week 8, I'll have:
- 3 working AI prototypes
- 1 complete case study
- 8 detailed guides
- Interview-ready portfolio
- Public evidence of AI PM capability

**The goal:** Senior PM or AI PM role at 45k AED monthly.

**The timeline:** Land role by Q2 2026.

**The method:** Learn in public. Build in public. Ship in public.

## 🤝 Learning Philosophy

**Principles I Follow:**

1. **Learn by Building** - Theory is useless without practice
2. **Document Everything** - If I didn't write it down, I didn't learn it
3. **Share Publicly** - Teaching is the best way to learn
4. **Be Honest** - Share mistakes, not just wins
5. **Measure Progress** - Track time, completions, outcomes
6. **Stay Consistent** - Small daily progress beats sporadic intensity

**What Makes This Different:**

- Not a tutorial collection, but a complete system
- Not just learning tools, but building products
- Not hiding mistakes, but documenting them
- Not theory-heavy, but project-driven
- Not generic examples, but MENA-specific context
